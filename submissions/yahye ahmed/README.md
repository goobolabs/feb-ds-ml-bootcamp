# Machine Learning And Data Science Bootcamp Assignments

Student Name: Yahye Ahmed Omar
Bootcamp: Machine Learning Data Science  

## About Me 
My name is Yahye Ahmed Omar, and I am a final-year (Semester 8) Computer Science student at SIMAD University. I am a motivated and growing Full Stack Developer, with a strong focus on modern web technologies.
I have been actively building my skills through both university studies and private technical training programs. Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in a bootcamp sponsored by Dugsiye, which provided two intensive courses: JavaScript and React. This program gave us a unique chance to enhance our understanding and practical skills, particularly in modern web development, as well as to explore foundational concepts in Machine Learning and Data Science, which will greatly support our future growth.

I am passionate about continuous learning, collaboration, and contributing to real-world projects. This repository represents part of my learning journey and practical contribution through the bootcamp.

I am deeply grateful to Dugsiye and to our instructors @Sharafdin and @Omartood for making this experience possible and for guiding us throughout the learning process.
