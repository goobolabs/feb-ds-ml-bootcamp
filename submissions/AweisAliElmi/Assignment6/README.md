# Spending Pattern Analysis - Assignment 6

This folder contains my work for **Assignment 6 – Spending Pattern Analysis with K-Means (Clustering)**. The project explores customer segmentation based on income and spending habits using unsupervised learning.

## Contents

- **spending_clustering.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook containing the full clustering workflow:
  - Data loading and preprocessing (handling missing values).
  - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.
  - Optimal cluster determination via the **Elbow Method** (SSE calculation).
  - Model training with **K-Means**.
  - Performance evaluation using **Silhouette Score** and **Davies–Bouldin Index**.
  - Cluster center analysis in original units.

- **spending_reflection.md**  
  A reflection paper answering assignment questions, including:
  - Description of the K-Means implementation.
  - Justification for the chosen **K** value based on metrics.
  - Interpretation of customer segments (e.g., High Income / High Spending).
  - Suggested business actions for each cluster and discussion of limitations.

- **spending_labeled_clusters.csv**  
  The final output dataset with an added `Cluster` column assigning each customer to their respective segment.

## Dataset

- Uses `spending_l9_dataset.csv`, which contains customer information including `CustomerID`, `Age`, `Income_$`, and `SpendingScore`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Note on Windows Compatibility
- The notebook includes a fix for a known K-Means memory leak warning on Windows by setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`.
